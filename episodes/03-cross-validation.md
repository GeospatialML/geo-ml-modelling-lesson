## Introduction

In this lesson, ....

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```python
print("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Output

```output
This new lesson looks good
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides":
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
